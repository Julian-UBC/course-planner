My Personal Project

Course Planning
===============

I came up with an idea about course planning. This application will mainly help users to plan the courses they
should take to fulfill their requirements to graduate from university (for now only works for UBC). For now, people
that will use my application will be *UBC Computer Science Students*. Hopefully in the future, all students in UBC 
or even students from any universities can use my application. The reason I want to make **Course Planning** 
application for my project is because I want to use this application to help me plan what courses to take, so
I can fulfill the requirements to graduate.

P.S. I came up with this idea before knowing the functionality of *Degree Navigator* in SSC.

User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a course to my course list 
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of courses on my course list
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a course from my course list
- As a user, I want to be able to see the requirements that I have fulfilled, and the requirements that I haven't 
  fulfilled
